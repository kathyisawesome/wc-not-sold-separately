# Not Sold Separately for WooCommerce

Limit WooCommerce products to being sold only as part of a [Mix and Match](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-mix-and-match-products/), [Bundle](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-mix-and-match-products/?aff=5151&cid=8069770), or [Composite](https://woocommerce.com/products/composite-products//?aff=5151&cid=8069770) product.

## Usage

1. Download and install as plugin.

2. Edit a simple product and navigate to the "Inventory" tab in the product data metabox.

3. For an individual variation, you can set the status in the variation options.

4. Save the product/variation.

When visiting the single product page, the add to cart button should now be gone:

And that particular variation should not be visible when visiting a variable product page.

However, the product can still be purchased as part of a container:
